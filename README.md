# Advanced-Terrain-Generation-Tool
An application to create large, open 2D worlds using procedural and other methods of random generation.


To run for yourself, you'll need to:
1. Download Java
2. Download the repository project files
3. Download Netbeans (what we used for development) and create a new project
4. Move the repository folders (gui, misc, resources, world) into the src folder of the created Java project
5. Run gui.java in the gui folder

The project is quite a bit to explain. There's the layering tool and all the algorithms used to generate 2D environments. I recommend playing around with it, that should be enough to get familiar with a lot of the functionality.
