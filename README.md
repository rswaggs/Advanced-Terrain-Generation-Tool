# Advanced-Terrain-Generation-Tool
An application to create large, open 2D worlds using procedural and other methods of random generation.

### Tools
The project uses Java GUI packages. Specifically AWT and Swing.

### Summary
The project is quite a bit to explain. There's the layering tool and all the algorithms used to generate 2D environments. You select or create new layers first. Then for each layer you can run different algorithms to fill in the grid space. The algorithms are dependent on what was previously filled in from previously layers. For the algorithms, some are designed for top-down views, while others are designed for side scrolling views.

I recommend playing around with it, that should be enough to get familiar with a lot of the functionality.


### Getting Started
To run for yourself, you'll need to:
1. Download Java
2. Download the repository project files
3. Download Netbeans (what we used for development) and create a new project
4. Move the repository folders (gui, misc, resources, world) into the src folder of the created Java project
5. Run gui.java in the gui folder
